## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
The main problem that this project wants to solve is the difficulty in having the items processed and delivered right in time. Specifically, the problem includes:
1.	Problems due to processing of untraceable items.
2.	Delay in processing of items due to high number of deliveries.
3.	Proof of receipt for the sender to know that the item has been received.

### Proposed Solution
The general objective of this project is to develop two mobile applications – one, for the messenger to add and update the tracking of the items for the customers; two, an application for the customers where QR code scanning and Tracking Number will be used to track the items. 
1.	To develop a tracking module for each item to be delivered.
When the items to be delivered are in the delivery phase, the client is not informed of the whereabouts of the items. They just have to hold on to the date given to them by the company. But there are times that the messenger had delivered the item a day or so later than the specified date, and there are also cases that when it happens, the receiver, or anybody available, is not home.
So, for the customers to lessen the burden of waiting just to be disappointed, the proponents aim to consider the eventual tracking of the items, update the customers the whereabouts of their items and, to send them text messages about the updates.
2.	To add batch processing for the items that of the same route.
There are instances that the deliveries may have been delivered late because of too much items to be delivered held by the messenger. As a solution, batch processing shall be used to prevent delays in deliveries.
3.	To provide a digital signature which will be digitally given by the receiver and a Portable Document Format (pdf) file will be provided for the customer’s application and website to check that the item’s been received.
When the item is received, the sender is never informed by the company that the item has been delivered to its respective receiver, unless the receiver informs the sender himself. To have a better update on both sides, a digital signature should work which will be uploaded in the application for both customers to see proof that the items have been received.

**Features of the System**
1.	Realtime Item Tracing
2.	Text Messaging Module
3.	QR Code scanning
4.	Customer Digital signature

### Target Users
* _Customers (Sender and Receiver)_

The system will help them trace the delivery status of the items they sent to be delivered to its respective receiver. Also, if their receiver already received the items, a proof will be available for them to verify if the items had been received by the right person.

* _Courier Company_

This system will be beneficial to any courier company. Not only, their items will be tracked but there are also other features of the system that their regular customers will absolutely patronize.

* _Company Personnel_

Given a huge number of customers and items to be delivered, using the system, company personnel will be able to monitor, and manage them properly. For messengers, easiness of updating the whereabouts of the items can be so handy for the android application specially developed for them includes features that which can lessen the energy that they're exerting for the job.

### Benefits
The project of producing two mobile applications will help those courier customers who wish nothing but for their delivery items to be delivered on the right time specified to the right receivers. And for the sender, he won’t be worrying as to what the status of the items he got delivered is. And he needs not to worry about any conflicts with the item as long as it’s traceable.

The advantage of having a customer side on our application is for them to track their delivered items. Customers can see the courier’s location on the map provided on our system; date and time included. To the courier side of our mobile application, messengers can manage the items being delivered through batch processing. In this case, the person assigned to deliver can distribute the items to which and when they are going to be delivered. The results of this project can reduce the waiting time of the customers and for them to be notified when their packages can be delivered to them, and lessen their worry about the delivery status of the items.
